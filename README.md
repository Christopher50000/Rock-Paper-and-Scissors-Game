# Rock-Paper-and-Scissors-Game

This program allows the user to play against a computer in a simple game of rock, paper, and scissors. Once the user is done playing, they input q and then the program will display every round, play of the user and computer, and the outcome of the round. Creating this program helped me understand: 1. Using lists and dictionaries, 2. Using lists help with using less conditionals (saves a lot of time), 3. Using a list inside another list (a sublist), and 4. Aligning strings. This is also will serve as a historic repo to look back on for myself.
