# Rock-Paper-and-Scissors-Game

This program allows the user to play against a computer in a simple game of rock, paper, and scissors. Once the user is done playing, they input q and then the program will display every round, play of the user and computer, and the outcome of the round.

This program helped me understand:

-Using lists and dictionarys
-Using lists to use less conditionals
-Using a list inside another list (a sublist)
-Aligning strings
